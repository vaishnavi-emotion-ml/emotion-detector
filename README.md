# 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text using NLP

This project is built as part of the Cyfuture ASE Trainee AIML assignment.

🔍 Problem

This project is a simple machine learning application that detects emotions in user-inputted text using natural language processing (NLP). It classifies text into one of the following six emotions:

- 😊 Happy
- 😢 Sad
- 😠 Angry
- 😌 Calm
- 😨 Fear
- ❤️ Love

The project is implemented in Python using libraries like `scikit-learn`, `neattext`, and `seaborn`.
